    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <hr />
    <p>What seems to be just another page in your sitemap, probably accessible through your header and/or footer, is actually 
        one of your most compelling pieces of content. Or at least, it should be.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Yes, we’re talking about your website’s About Us page.
        
        In some ways, it’s actually more appropriate to refer to this type of page as “Our Brand Story,” or if you want another alternative, “Our Identity.” We like the first one better, but they’re both pretty accurate.</p>
